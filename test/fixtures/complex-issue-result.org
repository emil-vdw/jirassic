** 🛠️ Test Issue for API Serialization
/This is a dummy Jira ticket created for testing purposes./
The goal is to validate the serialization and deserialization of Jira API responses within our application.
-----

*** 📋 Acceptance Criteria
+ The issue can be retrieved via the API.
+ The serialized fields match the original Jira fields (e.g., ~summary~, ~description~, ~status~, ~priority~, ~assignee~).
+ No unexpected fields or errors occur during parsing.

#+BEGIN_SRC c
int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  return 0;
} 
#+END_SRC
-----

*** 🧪 Steps to Reproduce

**** Create a request to fetch this issue via the Jira API:

#+begin_expand
GET /rest/api/3/issue/PROJ-123
#+end_expand

#+begin_expand *Old API*
GET /rest/api/3/issue/PROJ-123
#+end_expand


**** Serialize the _{response} into your application's model.

**** Validate the model fields against expected values.
